# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# Ignore the secrets, obviously - I sure hope this is sufficient!
/config/secrets.yml

# The Devise config has a generated key that would probably be wise to leave out of git
# I hope this won't cause issues with anyone else trying to run it - maybe it can be moved
# to secrets.yml?
# nevermind, it was commented out by default!

#/config/initializers/devise.rb
