# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# vim makes these files
*.swp

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# Less important in Rails 5.2, but no reason to expose it now
/config/secrets.yml

# contains the production redis server address, which probably is a good idea to keep mum
/config/redis.yml

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key

# Elastic Beanstalk Files
.ebignore
.elasticbeanstalk/*
.ebextensions/*
!.elasticbeanstalk/*.cfg.yml
!.elasticbeanstalk/*.global.yml
